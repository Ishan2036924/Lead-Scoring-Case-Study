Lead Scoring Case Study 

Problem Statement:

X Education is an online learning platform that offers courses to industry professionals. Many professionals visit the website daily, browse through courses, and fill out a form to express interest. These individuals are then considered as leads.

Once a lead is acquired, the sales team reaches out via calls and emails to convert them into paying customers. However, the current lead conversion rate is around 30%, meaning out of 100 acquired leads, only about 30 get converted.

To improve this process, the company wants to identify high-potential leads (Hot Leads) so that the sales team can focus on them rather than reaching out to every lead indiscriminately. This will help optimize manpower and improve efficiency.

Business Objective :

X Education wants to build a Lead Scoring Model that assigns a score (between 0 and 100) to each lead. The goal is to:

Identify Hot Leads to increase the conversion rate.
Achieve a lead conversion rate of 80%.
Develop a model that can adapt to future challenges, such as:
Handling peak-time lead conversions.
Optimizing sales team efforts.
Defining the best approach after achieving the target.
The model should help the sales team prioritize leads effectively and improve overall business performance.
